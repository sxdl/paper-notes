goal of 3D object detection is to identify category labels of objects and locate 3D boundary boxes from a point cloud scen, playing a crucial role in applications in autonomous driving and robotics[].\nRecent works~\\cite{liu2021group, qi2019deep, rukhovich2022fcaf3d, shi2023pv, shi2019pointrcnn, shi2020points, wang2022cagroup3d, yang20203dssd, zhou2018voxelnet, chen2023voxelnext, wang2022sparse2dense, yin2021center, fan2022fully} have made significant progress in 3D object detection. However, obtaining a large amount of carefully annotated 3D scene data is very expensive and time-consuming.To overcome the limitation, semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods leverage a combination of few labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to enhance training and improve model performance. Prior works~\\cite{zhao2020sess, wang20213dioumatch, ho2023diffusion, wang2023not} [sess, 3dioumatch, diffusion-ss3d, not-every-side-is-equal, DPKE] adopt a student-teacher framework with asymmetric data augmentation to train the student model through pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization. For instance, SESS~\\cite{zhao2020sess} ... 3DIoUMatch~\\cite{wang20213dioumatch} ... NESE~\\cite{wang2023not} ... Diffusion-SS3D~\\cite{ho2023diffusion} ... Specifically, One of the critical keys to the well-performed semi-supervised learning is the strong augmentation strategy. Strong augmentation aids in robust feature learning by exposing the model to a wide range of transformations, which enhances its ability to detect objects under various real-world conditions. Additionally, it prevents overfitting by introducing variability into the training process, ensuring that the model generalizes better to novel, unseen data. Specifically, these approaches focused on scene-level augmentation strategies, such as flipping, rotation, and scaling. However, only utilize scene-level augmentation can suffer from limited diversity. This is because applying uniform transformations to entire scenes does not significantly alter individual objects within the scene, leading to less variability at the object level. As a result, the model may not experience a wide range of object poses or appearances, limiting its ability to learn robust, object-specific features necessary for accurate detection under varied conditions.

camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. \\\n‰∏â‰∏™ÈÉ®ÂàÜÔºö3D Gaussians„ÄÅoptimization of
